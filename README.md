<h1>S&P 500 Trading Predictor Model</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The main objective of this project is to develop a prediction model for the S&P 500 index, aiming to forecast whether the index will increase or decrease on the following trading day. This paper outlines the steps taken to develop the solution, including data collection, the methodology used, and the insights obtained. Furthermore, additional predictors and methods like rolling averages and an increased success threshold were introduced to enhance the accuracy of the predictions. Comparisons between the model before and after the introduction of new predictors and methods are made. Moreover, a random baseline model was also created to draw comparisons from the Random Forest model, evaluating the effectiveness of the developed model. Additional metrics like ROC-AUC score and Confusion Matrix that measure performance are also introduced to gain additional information on how well the model performs.
